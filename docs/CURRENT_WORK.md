# Current Work

This file is short-term memory for the current development thread. Update it when the active focus changes.

## Active Theme

The current major thread is the GPU rendering refactor and backend alignment:

- Common Canvas behavior has moved into `src/render/gpu_canvas.*`.
- GL backend behavior lives in `src/render/gl/gl_canvas.*` and `src/render/gl/gl_command.*`.
- Metal backend behavior lives in `src/render/metal/mtl_canvas.*` and `src/render/metal/mtl_render.*`.
- GL is usually the behavior reference; Metal should match semantics without copying GL state-machine habits blindly.

## Recent Local State Observed

Commit `04995bae5` (`refactor(render): split GPUCanvas core and align GL/Metal backends`) landed a large render refactor. The codebase is now organized around `GPUCanvas` plus backend command implementations. Treat this as the current baseline, not a temporary diff.

Notable render-side state:

- Old `src/render/gl/gl_cmd.*` is deleted.
- New `src/render/gl/gl_command.*` exists and owns GL command packing/calls.
- New `src/render/gpu_canvas.*` exists and owns shared Canvas logic.
- GL blur has been refactored from fixed full-surface temporary textures to pooled dynamic textures. The GL path now keeps temporary blur textures alive through `GC_BlurFilter`, offsets the root matrix for local rendering, downsamples/mip-copies into the pooled texture, and uses shader UV offsets for final writeback.
- Troubleshooting notes are recorded in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, including
  the GL UBO storage issue where `_uboClip` was bound but had no data store
  until clipping first ran, causing misleading black/gradient output.
- `Canvas::swapBuffer()` now returns `bool` to signal backend back-pressure/busy state.
- `Canvas::drawTriangles()` accepts `copyData`; GL deferred commands must copy transient triangle data when requested.
- `RenderResource` now exposes upload/unload resource ownership APIs (`uploadTexture`, `unloadTexture`, `uploadVertexData`, `unloadVertexData`) plus `RenderResource::useVertexData()`.
- `ImageSource` / `TexStat` were reworked around caller-owned texture state and multiple texture slots; do not reintroduce backend-owned `TexStat` allocation lifetimes.
- Metal `MTL_CmdPack` contains a `recorded` flag and tracks command buffers, current command buffer, pass descriptor, encoder, and pipeline.
- Metal `MetalCanvas::endPass()` centralizes ending the current encoder/pass and marking the command pack recorded.
- Metal `readImageCmd()` currently has a blit fast path when source/destination size and pixel format match, otherwise it uses the parameterized `cp` shader path.
- Metal `outputImageBeginCmd()` and `outputImageEndCmd()` are implemented at least partially through `mtl_rebuild_texture()`, render-target switching, and mipmap generation.
- Metal `drawClipCmd()` now renders clip masks into pooled `ImageSource` textures, restores clip state through shader clip texture/stat bindings, and follows GL intersect/difference mask combination semantics.
- Metal blur begin/end now uses pooled `tmpA`/`tmpB` textures from `GPUCanvas`, restores the root matrix after temp rendering, and uses the `cp`/`blur` shader paths for mip downsample and ping-pong blur; it still needs visual validation.

Current Metal backend state:

- Metal canvas command implementations have been split into `src/render/metal/mtl_canvas_cmd.mm`.
- The Metal backend now covers the GL-aligned draw path, including color/image/YUV/mask/SDF/gradient/rrect blur/triangles, clip masks, blur filters, `readImage()`, `outputImage()`, and viewport present copy.
- Metal command encoding now tracks explicit render-pass/encoder lifetime, front/current command packs, transient buffer allocation, sampler caching, depth state, and pipelines keyed by Metal pixel format.
- Visual validation is still useful for anti-aliased difference clips, nested clip restore behavior, blur edge sampling, and output-image mipmap use.

## Important Cautions

- Do not assume earlier conversation state is still true; inspect the current file before patching. The user may have edited between turns.
- Avoid pushing current Metal command buffers into `_cmdPack.cmds` unless command ordering truly requires it.
- In Metal, switching render targets requires ending the current `MTLRenderCommandEncoder`, but not necessarily creating a new `MTLCommandBuffer`.
- Prefer shader slot indices from shader structs, such as `shader.fragment.image`, over hard-coded texture slots.
- `copyData` matters for deferred GL command data lifetime. Metal direct encoding may have different lifetime requirements.
- The render coordinate convention moved toward screen-space y-down with final-present Y flip in shaders; do not add ad hoc Y flips without checking `math.h`, `vport_cp.glsl`, and `vport_full_cp.glsl`.
- `PaintImage` bitfields and mipmap modes changed; check `paint.h` before assuming old filter/mipmap encodings.
- `Pixel::body()` was renamed to `Pixel::buffer()`.

## Suggested Next Render Tasks

- Add visual regression coverage for Metal clipping, blur, readback, and output-image behavior against the GL reference output.
- Exercise macOS Metal window resizing/presentation behavior and decide whether to keep the custom `CAMetalLayer` path or move to `MTKView`.
- Add or refresh small render regression demos if the project has an existing lightweight path for them.

## Verification Preference

For small render backend changes:

- Use targeted `rg` and local source inspection first.
- Do not run broad builds unless requested.
- If compiling is needed, ask or use the project’s known lightweight command if available.
